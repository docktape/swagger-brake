# swagger-brake
The idea behind swagger-brake is to detect and prevent introducing any type of breaking API change within 
your application, so your APIs can remain backward-compatible at all times.

You can find the detailed documentation [here](https://docktape.github.io/swagger-brake/).

The available releases can be found [here](https://github.com/docktape/swagger-brake/releases)

The master branch represents the ongoing development of the tool. For the
release versions, you can check out the corresponding tags.

On top of the CLI interface, there are Maven and Gradle plugins also available for 
easier integration into any existing pipeline.

Maven plugin can be found [here](https://github.com/docktape/swagger-brake-maven-plugin).

Gradle plugin can be found [here](https://github.com/docktape/swagger-brake-gradle).

## Building
The application is using Gradle as a build system and building it can be done 
by executing the following command:
```bash
$ ./gradlew clean build shadowJar
```
